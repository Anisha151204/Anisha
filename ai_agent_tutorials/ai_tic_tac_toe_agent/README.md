# AI vs AI Tic-Tac-Toe Game üéÆ

An interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game where two AI agents powered by different language models compete against each other built on phidata Agent Framework and Streamlit as UI. Watch as GPT-4O battles against either DeepSeek V3 or Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash in this classic game!

## Features üåü

- Player X: Powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o (o1 models as api is yet to roll out for tier)
- Player O: Choice between DeepSeek AI or Google's Gemini
- Interactive game board using Streamlit
- Real-time move visualization
- AI Judge to determine game outcomes
- Clean and intuitive user interface

## Prerequisites üìã

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key
- Either DeepSeek API key or Google API key (for Player O)

## How to Run üöÄ

1. **Setup Environment**
   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps.git
   cd ai_agent_tutorials/ai_tic_tac_toe_agent

   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configure API Keys**
   - Get OpenAI API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com)
   - Get Google API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com) (if using Gemini)
